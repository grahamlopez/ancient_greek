We are building a list of ancient Greek vocabulary to drill and learn. I will give you a list of ancient Greek words. You should help me turn it into a formatted list that I can then import into a flashcard drilling program. 

I am providing a step by step process, followed by examples of what the completed output should look like.

Step 1: 
sort the edited list alphabetically based on the Greek headword.

Step 2:
convert each word into an entry with 2 or 3 fields, separated by a literal TAB character. 

These fields should be:
- The first field is the Greek word in the complete form in which it would be found in a standard ancient Greek lexicon like Liddel and Scott, for example:
   - for nouns: nominative, genitive ending, article. Follow the examples provided
   - for verbs, the uncontracted, first person present form
- The second field is the english definition as provided, or if none is provided by me, please supply your own.
- The third field should be helpful grammatical information, such as
    - the verb conjugation family e.g. thematic, irregular, α,ε,ο contract, middle voice, etc.
    - the declension it belongs to from: 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 2a, 2b, 3a, etc.
    - any other useful information to learn when drilling the vocabulary

Step 3:
catgorize the edited and alphabetized list of words into separate sections of:
- nouns
- adjectives and adverbs
- verbs
- prepositions
- particles and miscellaneous


Here is an example of what the final output should look like. Follow the steps above to produce output that looks exactly like the following example:
